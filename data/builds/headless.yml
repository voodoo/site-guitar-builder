    title: Starting with 1 5/8" thick walnut
    body: Starting with 1 5/8" thick walnut but that will get thinned out once the top is on. White paper represents a book matched spalted maple cap, which will be ~1/4 - 5/16" thick. Fret board is curly maple to match the maple strips in the neck.

        title: Heres the guitar from which the hardware was taken. Made a template for this bridge cavity from 1/2' sandply. Front end of the cavity was a bit tight on the original so I added 1/8". 
      - src: leg-rest.jpg
        title: Took it down 7/16". The original cavity would have left ~1/4" at the rear so I opened it up all the way. Nothing will stick out that end to get in the way as a leg rest..

    title: Final tung oil / Shielding paint
    body: Sat for a few weeks. Went over the whole thing with 0000 steel wool to knock down any nibs or rough spots from the last tung oil coat. Vacuumed and blew off the dust. Applied a coat of paste was, let that dry and polished. Then 2 coats of shielding paint in the cavities.

    title: Seymour Duncan Triple shot
    body: With all the guts installed. Using a Seymour Duncan triple shot ring to split the P rail into either single coil, parallel and serial humbuckers. <p> And the pup sounds good. Beginning to realize I don't have much of an ear for pup subtleties other than being able to say that they are either very bright, medium or dull. I would call this one medium. A nice single coil sound too. That's as eloquent as I can wax. I like the triple shot ring. Nice option when a slew of knobs won't fit.
