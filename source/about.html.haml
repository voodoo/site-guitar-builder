%h1.fancy Who is this for?

%ul

    %h5 Builders
    %ul
      %li 
        %b Inventory
        Gather the necessary details for the builds
      %li Builders can provide their own inventory that represents your opinions
      %li Build your own visual designs that represent your opinions
      %li Visually document your builds - automatically adding content to your site for marketing purposes
  %li 
    %h5 Players 
    %ul
      %li Who want to build and/or design their own guitar
      %li Share your ideas with others - have others contribute and/or provide feedback
      %li Articulate your design in detail so the builder can bring it to life


%h1.fancy Why?

%p One day I decided I wanted to design my own guitar.
%p
  I 
  = link_to "documented the process", "http://git.vudmaska.com/"
  , to help the builder, and these tools are the distillation (and extension of) that process. 
%p 
  I hope you find them useful.

%h4 PS

%p Right now, things are completely static - on purpose, there are great benefits to this.
%p In the future, Builder may be a sort of portal. Here are some of the use cases.

%h5 Builders

%ul
  %li Use the tools to document your builds in a visually appealling, easy way
  %li Be a recommended builder
  %li 'Builds' will be a little like a forum thread but more focused on the process
  %li Collaborate with the buyer and others
  %li Bid on builds

%h5 Buyers

%ul
  %li Have builders bid on your build
  %li Provide the highest price possible - allow builders to bid
  %li Thereby inverting the buying process



%h5 Both

%ul
  %li Use Builder &amp; Talk (forum) as a community for guitar enthusiasts
  %li Links between Talk and Builder will be practical and useful
  %li For example, profiles in Talk will have links to their virtual build (or actual build) - identifying what makes them tick in terms of guitars
